- Added a buff/debuff system
- Corrected the issues with the move select function
- Removed the PlayerController class for now (may not need it)
- Further separated the differences between the Player class and the Character class
- Added a few new attributes to the Actions class to better represent what is needed from the class
- Added a system to reduce the stamina and mana of moves used that require that specific amount
- Added a system to check the resources to make sure the user can use the move with the stamina and mana that they have available
- Added an action method to the Player class which allows for the move to be used (needs more work in order to have it be more robust and modular)
