- Added Character class as Super class
- Added Player class as a child of the Character class and some beginning methods that the player class will use
- Added empty Enemy, Ifrit, and PlayerController class
- Added Actions class, used to setup the blueprint of how the moves that characters will use in battles will be stored.

Looking to finish the implementation of the Player class and begin the functionality of the PlayerController class that will handle a good amount of the attacking, defending and resource management.

Also looking to start the tedious process of creating a robust enemy AI system to facilitate the enemies decision making.

Future Implementation:
- Enemy AI
- Battle Mechanics
- Resource Management
- Game Over mechanics
- Selectable Classes (Warrior, Ifrit, Thief, Cultist)
- Gold System
- Shop System
- XP and Upgrade System
- Leveling System
    - Make the stats of the player scale based on their level
