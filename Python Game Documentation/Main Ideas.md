Different characters, based on elements
- Fire (Slow Burn) - Applies stacks of burn causing the enemy to take damage at the end of the your turn (poison in Slay The Spire)
- does burn damage after every turn, per stack, removes a stack at the end of every turn (Like poison in Slay The Spire)
- Electricity (Rapid-Fire Big Burst Dmg) - Static charges until 5 or 10, don't know yet and then explodes doing a burst of damage to the target. OR the player has certain moves that can ask for an "Overcharge" or something that does extra damage based on the static stack on the enemy, but removes all charges
- Ice (Debuff) - Reduce the target's attack value by 1 per 2 stacks or something and once the enemy reaches some number they get frozen, causing them to skip a turn?
- Stone (Defense) - Stacks on the target nullify that amount of damage
- Nature (Manipulator?) - Stacks of pollen reduce the target's attack values, once the stacks reach a certain amount the next attack from the target, hits an ally or themselves

It would be nice if this was a rougelike deckbuilder but I am not sure if I know how to make that into the game at the moment in Python!
